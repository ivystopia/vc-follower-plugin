# vcFollowerPlugin

## What is this?

This is a custom plugin for Vencord that allows you to follow users' activities. It is designed to help you stay informed about when specific users send messages, join channels, or perform various other activities within Discord.

## Is it working?

Mostly. You will get some of what you want.

_The dev branch is unstable, and commits will be force-pushed there._

## Why?

- To enhance your Discord experience by keeping you updated on the activities of users you care about
- To make Discord feel more like old-school chatroom and messaging apps, which provided this feature as standard

## Features

- Displays a popup notification when a followed user performs various actions:
  - Sends or edits a message in any channel
  - Deletes a message in any channel
  - Starts typing in any channel
  - Creates a thread
  - Updates their bio, profile picture, or global name (Work In Progress)
- All actions are configurable
- Users can be added/removed via the right-click menu, or by adding their user IDs manually in the plugin settings

## How to Install

1. Install the plugin [vc-message-logger-enhanced](https://github.com/Syncxv/vc-message-logger-enhanced/).
2. Install vcFollowerPlugin from the repository you are reading now.
3. Confused? [Check the Vencord development documentation](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing).
4. Installing this plugin is up to you.
   - If you do not understand the installation process, you should stick to the built-in Vencord plugins.
   - Installing custom plugins without an understanding of the overall process **opens you up to the risk of your Discord account being compromised**
   - The maintainer(s) of this plugin will not support you during the installation process.

## Origins

- This is a hard fork of an existing similar plugin. That plugin is still available, but I wish to take development in a different direction which is incompatible with the motivation of the original plugin.
- Features from the other plugin WILL NOT be ported to this plugin
- Features from this plugin SHOULD NOT be ported to the other plugin
- The software licenses are ambiguous. Please reach out to me using my [PGP key](https://github.com/ivystopia.gpg) if you have any questions or concerns.
